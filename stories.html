        <h1 style="color: white;">Cycling in Raratonga</h1>
        <h4 style="color: white">My time spent in Raratonga opened my eyes and mind. The experiences ranges from
        learing culturally about different practices and people and the lifestyles caused me 
        to change my outlook on what goals I would set for my life.The idea of success slowly 
        faded away as a priority and the ideas of connection and peace slowly worked their way 
        into my mind as priorities or simply options for priorities. I began to realize the 
        fulfillment of my life was not limited by my abilities as much as the perspectives I held towards it.  </h4>
