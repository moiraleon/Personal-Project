        <h1 style="color: white;">Cycling in Raratonga</h1>
        <h4 style="color: white">My time spent in Raratonga opened my eyes and mind. The experiences ranges from
        learning culturally about different practices and people and the lifestyles caused me 
        to change my outlook on what goals I would set for my life.The idea of success slowly 
        faded away as a priority and the ideas of connection and peace slowly worked their way 
        into my mind as priorities or simply options for priorities. I began to realize the 
        fulfillment of my life was not limited by my abilities as much as the perspectives I held towards it.  </h4>

      <h4 style="color: white">Raratonga was full of flavorful fruit, endless papayas,chickens,
         coconut trees and mosquitos. Regardless of the many months I spent sleep deprived on the island I could always justify staying because
        of the overwhelming amount of love I felt and the open heartedness of all the people I met. To be accepted and loved and welcomed into someone home 
      right away felt so different from the customs I gre up with in the US but all at the same time it felt more familiar and more like me. I never imagined
    that being so far away from the place that had been my home would finally lead me to understand the meaning of home itself. AUnties who make you homemade fruitcakes and 
  invite you over just to have tea, fishermen and local marine biologist without hesitation inviting you to be a part of every celebration and event. I felt like 
I had felt the feeling I had always hoped to experience with family for the first time. </h4>

      <h1 style="color: white;">Swimming with Dolphins</h1>
      <h4 style="color: white">Living in Hawaii on my own caused me to feel connection to the earth and nature in a way I had never experienced. I was changing
      so fast but at the same time growing into who I had always been. The weather never skipped on an opportunity to help me acknowledge the beauty the earth had to offer
    and to leave me absolutely in awe with what I was able to observe wiht my own eyes. On a random weekend for a birthday of a friend we spent the night camping
  on the beach when it started to rain but we merely covered our faces and slept through it. In the early morning we woke up to find some of our belongings missing
including my phone which had been inches away from my face. We dismissed it and went out on our adventure to swim and snorkel with the dolphins. The cool but chill air
is somehting I can still feel having nothing other than a towl and a wet swimsuit. My ankles sore from running left me without the strength to maneuver my flippers
and carried me out in a wave but when you are 19 dying isn't quite as much of a concern as is missing out on seeing dolphins. The experience overall was deserving of more
than what I can put in words and the threatening phone call from the person who stole my phone as we arrived home couldn't shake my euphoria from the experience.
Was the realization of some unknown person snagging my ohone from inches away form my body as I laid dead asleep horrifying to realize? Yes, of course. But that is a story for another time.  </h4>
